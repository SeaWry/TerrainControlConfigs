YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE THESE CONFIGS OR FILES

These may be used from here.

You may use them for private use, but you CANNOT distribute them. 

These files are part of a powerful system, without the other needed plugins they are useless. 


These are part of the My Little Craft project. They are not nor should be used/modified outside the master server they are designed for.
